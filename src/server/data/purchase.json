[{"id":8,"title":"SAINT ALBRAY","price":860.62,"description":"Saint Albray is a flower-shaped cheese that comes from the Aquitaine region of France. Made with pasteurised cow's milk and ripened for 2 weeks, it slices off skilfully with each half-pound cut looking like a \"petal\". When each petal comes together around a disk, they form a hollow centre similar to a flower.","category":"soft, soft-ripened","image":"https://www.cheese.com/media/img/cheese/12-saint-albray-shutterstock_1222710106.jpg","amount":1},{"id":7,"title":"ROYALP TILSIT","price":625.57,"description":"oyalp Tilsit or Swiss Tilsit is a light yellow semi-hard smear-ripened cheese made from unpasteurised/pasteurised cow milk. The pasteurised version is mild in flavour whereas the one made from fresh, unpasteurised milk is more strongly flavoured (called Farmhouse Tilsit). It is aged for about 5 months, which makes it a very strong smelling cheese comparable to a Limburger.","category":"semi-hard, smear-ripened","image":"https://www.cheese.com/media/img/cheese/Tilsit_cheese_1.jpg","amount":1}]
